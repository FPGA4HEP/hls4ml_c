    HLS pragmas can be used to optimize the design : improve throughput, reduce latency and 
    device resource utilization of the resulting RTL code
    This is a wrapper to be used with an hls4ml project to enable proper handling by SDAccel

// All the global memory access arguments must be associated to one m_axi(AXI Master Interface). Here all two arguments(in, out) are

// accessing global memory through this interface.
// Multiple interfaces can also be created based on the requirements. For example when multiple memory accessing arguments need access to
// global memory simultaneously, user can create multiple master interfaces and can connect to different arguments.
